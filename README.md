# Covid Phase Identifier

This is a web application that will tell you what phase your county is in for the Washington Safe Start program (COVID-19) based on the zip code you enter.

## How it works

This works by using the Google Maps API to convert your zip code to a county and then scraping the https://coronavirus.wa.gov website to determine what phase of the program you are in.

## Technologies used

React, Node, Express, Google Maps API, Cheerio for web scraping, Hosted on Heroku
